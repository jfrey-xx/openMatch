Put LSL library in "lsl" subfolder if not provided.

eg: ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/LSL/SDK/liblsl-Python-1.10.2.zip

"lsl_ov": put pylsl.py from reguval LSL + openvibe version of the library (avoids crash on linux plateformes), renamed to follow LSL convention. Eg: on linux 64bit copy "openvibe-1.0.1-src/dependencies/lib/liblsl.so" to "lsl_ov/liblsl64.so"
