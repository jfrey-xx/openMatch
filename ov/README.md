OpenViBE scenarios for recordings.

Tested with OpenViBE 1.0.1

coadapt: first try... before relizing that scripts not ready for v1.0

p300: WIP for 8 channels test... but in fact directly moved to a 16 channels fight

p300-16: final (?) version for 16 channels comparison of ERPs

external: use in combination with external programs (e.g. workload n-back task). relies on LSL for stims.
